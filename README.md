# Globalingo

Globalingo is a chatting application used to connect people from all over the world. Users select their language and can immediately start talking with anyone, regardless of language barriers. All messages are translated in real time, allowing for instant communication. 

# How It Works

Globalingo utilizes websockets to allow users to send messages between machines. Messages are then translated to the language the user has selected by using the Google Translate API.
